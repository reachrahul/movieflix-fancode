# movieflix-fancode
A react native application to fetch movie data with bi-directional infinite scrolling

#pre-requisites 
react-native and node version 18.0.0
check node version list: $nvm ls 
use version 18 if available otherwise install it: $nvm use v18.0.2

#Commands to run
$npm install
$react-native run-android

#Functionality covered
**Major requirements**
● Layout and UI: To see the full movie description click the movie image
● Default page load state
● API integration: Used fetch api for basic needs, usually I use axios or RTK query.
● Genre Filter: multiple genre select(All selected by default)
● Code Quality: Used functional components and typescript for enhanced type safety, no prebuilt packages used.

**Bonus Requirements**
● React Native application ( I also know reactjs but due to bonus point i did it in React Native, wrote it in a way that code can be used for Reactjs as well)
● Smooth scrolling of list with loader
● Used typescript

**In-progress bonus point**
Search with infinite loading (Implementing it right now :) )
